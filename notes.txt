How this code works :

nodemap is a class at which the textfile of the map is converted to a map of nodes
the initialise fn handles the entry conditions of the data members of nodemap
a fn is made called goTo that takes a parameter of the next point that a robot should move to 
this fn is called inside the solve fn 
there is an array of struct [p,d] that would handle multiple pickups and destinations
