/*
The goal of this task is to develop an algorithm to solve a warehouse (reach a goal) without knowing
the warehouse as a whole from the get-go, you will need to explore the warehouse step by step.

You have to include "warehouse.h".

Your code goes in the *initialize* and *solve* functions. Read the instructions there carefully.

Compile your code using any c++ compiler and pass level filename as an argument, for example:
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
main.exe warehouse1.txt
*/

#include "warehouse.h"

void initialize()
{
    /*
    This function will run after the warehouse is loaded.
    */
}

void solve()
{
    /*
    This function will keep running forever until the goal is reached.

    You can access the warehouse API through below functions.

    Sense and Control:
        isWalkable(right, down): checks if cell around robot is walkable (right: [-1 0 1], down: [-1 0 1])
        moveRobot(right, down): moves player one step (right: [-1 0 1], down: [-1 0 1])

    Global Info:
        getRobotPos(): gets robot position in warehouse
        getGoalPos()  : gets goal position in warehouse
        getItemPos() : gets item position in warehouse

    Debugging:
        printMaze()  : prints warehouse as a whole
        printAround(): prints part of warehouse around robot
    */
   
   //Normally The shortest soln to solve it is moving all the way vertically and horizontally
  Point ro = getRobotPos();
  
   cout <<robotPos.row ; 
   cout << robotPos.col;
   
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    // Initalize level
    initMaze(argv[1]);

    initialize();

    // Game loop
    while (true)
    {
        // Check reached goal
        if (hasReachedGoal())
        {
            // Hurray!
            cout << "Reached Goal!" << endl;
            break;
        }

        // Solve maze
        solve();
    }
