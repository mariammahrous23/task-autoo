/*
The goal of this task is to develop an algorithm to solve a warehouse (reach a goal) without knowing
the warehouse as a whole from the get-go, you will need to explore the warehouse step by step.

You have to include "warehouse.h".

Your code goes in the *initialize* and *solve* functions. Read the instructions there carefully.

Compile your code using any c++ compiler and pass level filename as an argument, for example:
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
main.exe warehouse1.txt
*/

#include "warehouse.h"

void initialize()
{
    /*
    This function will run after the warehouse is loaded.
    */
    
}

void solve()
{
    /*
    This function will keep running forever until the goal is reached.

    You can access the warehouse API through below functions.

    Sense and Control:
        isWalkable(right, down): checks if cell around robot is walkable (right: [-1 0 1], down: [-1 0 1])
        moveRobot(right, down): moves player one step (right: [-1 0 1], down: [-1 0 1])

    Global Info:
        getRobotPos(): gets robot position in warehouse
        getGoalPos()  : gets goal position in warehouse
        getItemPos() : gets item position in warehouse

    Debugging:
        printMaze()  : prints warehouse as a whole
        printAround(): prints part of warehouse around robot
